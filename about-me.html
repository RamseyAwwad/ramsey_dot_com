<p>I'm a proud and true University of Pittsburgh computer science student graduating in August 2020 currently seeking internship/full-time roles in software engineering. My core strengths are communication, problem solving, and project planning. For a complete summary of my technical background and projects, please request my resumé and view my Github page @ https://github.com/RamseyAwwad .

I enjoy solving problems that challenge the creative mind and often find myself functioning at my best when I am able to apply my creative side.

My top priority is to find a challenging position at a competitive company that aligns with my strengths and technical skills. I have a natural interest in supporting people and have crafted a reputation for myself as someone who is reliable, supportive and who can lead. 

I have a strong interest in applied data structures and in new developments in technology. I work well in a variety of settings and in high-pressure situations, function well within collaborative teams and have a strong desire to lead discussions. I'm also trained and experienced in Java and Python.

My cover photo is of a Habitat for Humanity build I participated in in Haiti that followed the quake in 2011. I still stay in touch with members of my team and consider this build to be one of my most memorable moments and meaningful learning experiences.

I’m very well-traveled and have lived in the UK and the Middle East and travel to both every year. I lived in Kuwait growing up for almost a decade. I enjoy exploring different cultures and meeting people as I've done for most of my life.

 Other interests: 
- traveling (anywhere)
- exercising (cycling)
- percussion instruments (Electric drums)
- scuba (PADI certified Rescue/Nitrox Diver)
- belay rock climbing (Portugal)
- jazz / electronica (Billy Cobham, Koan)
- chess (Black or White)
- pinball (Stargate)
- cooking authentic cuisine (Arabic, Indian, Indonesian)

I'm also a Triumph Motorcycles and BMW Motorrad fanatic.</p>
