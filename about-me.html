<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a proud and true University of Pittsburgh computer science student graduating in August 2020 currently seeking 
 internship/full-time roles in software engineering. My core strengths are communication, problem solving, and project 
 planning. For a complete summary of my technical background and projects, please request my resumé and view my 
 Github page @ <a href="https://github.com/RamseyAwwad">GitHub.com/RamseyAwwad</a> .</p>
<p>I enjoy solving problems that challenge the creative mind and often find myself functioning at my best when I am able to 
 apply my creative side. My top priority is to find a challenging position at a competitive company that aligns with my 
 strengths and technical skills. I have a natural interest in supporting people and have crafted a reputation for myself as 
 someone who is reliable, supportive and who can lead. I have a strong interest in applied data structures and in new 
 developments in technology. I work well in a variety of settings and in high-pressure situations, function well within 
 collaborative teams and have a strong desire to lead discussions. I'm also trained and experienced in Java and Python. I’m 
 very well-traveled and have lived in the UK and the Middle East and travel to both every year. I lived in Kuwait growing up 
 for almost a decade. I enjoy exploring different cultures and meeting people as I've done for most of my life.</p>
